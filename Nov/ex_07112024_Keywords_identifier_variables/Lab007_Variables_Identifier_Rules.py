#Rules of Identifier (Variable Name)
#They start with a letter (A-Z or a-z)
#an underscore _ followed by zero or more letters
#underscores, and digits (0-9)
#Python is case-sensitive -> name, Name both are different
#so myVariable and myvariable are two different identifiers

_ = 12
#variable name -> identifier -> _
# = -> assignment operator
#variable value -> 12
